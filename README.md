# Neural-Network-with-just-Numpy
This is a project that showcases my knowledge with Neural Networks. For me to illustrate this I will be only using the Numpy package in python and not any other machine learning packages. The neural network will have an adjustable number of layers and nodes.  The activation function per layer can also be changed from either relu, sigmoid or tanh. I will be using a the MNIST dataset and predict whether the image is the number one (1) or it is a different digit (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) in which it will be labeled as zero (0). I got the MNIST dataset from kaggle so, it might no longer be the original.
